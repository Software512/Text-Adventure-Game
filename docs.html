    <h2>An explanation of the syntax</h2>
    <p>
        This text-based adventure game player lets you create your own text-based adventure games. You can do this by creating a custom file in a language called JSON. <br>
        JSON is made of objects, which start with a &quot;&lbrace;&quot; and end with a &quot;&rbrace;&quot;. Each object contains values, which follow the following format: &quot;key&quot;: value <br>
        This value can be either another object or a string. A string is a bit of text surrounded by a quotation mark &lpar;&apos; or &quot;&rpar; on both sides. <br>
        If the value is followed by another value in <span style="font-style: italic;">the same</span> object, it must be end with a comma like this:  &quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;,
    </p>
