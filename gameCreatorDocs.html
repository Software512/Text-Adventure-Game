    <h1>Text-Based Adventure Game Creator <span style="font-style: italic;">Documentation</span></h1>
    <p>
        The game creation tool is designed to be somewhat user-friendly, but not to protect the user from themselves in
        every possible scenario. <br>
        Mainly, there are the following things you need to look out for or the game player may throw an error:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unless the &quot;Option goes to other screen&quot; or &quot;Is end screen&quot; option is checked, you must
            have an option in the options list.</li>
        <li>The &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;text&quot; attributes should be set in each option.</li>
        <li>Do not have more than one option with the same name, as it will just be processed as the last value that was
            unique.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will make much more sense soon.</p>
    <h2>How to Use The Tool</h2>
    <p>
        First, open the <a href="gameCreator.html" target="_blank">text-based adventure game creation tool</a>. <br>
        Set the name of your game in the top-left corner. You can edit values in all the text boxes. <br>
        Create a new option by pressing the &quot;+&quot; button. The game file follows a nested structure of options.
        <br>
        When you are done, you can save your game with the &quot;Save&quot; and load it in either the <a
            href="index.html" target="_blank">game player</a> or the game creator tool. <br>
        Click the &quot;Preview Game&quot; button in the menu bar to test your game file. The preview will close when you click the button again or edit the game file.
    </p>
    <h2>What the Options Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Purpose: Required; What the user types in to make that choice.</li>
        <li>Header: Optional; What text is shown in the header at the top of th screen.</li>
        <li>Text: Required; What text is shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Disable undoing previous choice: Not recommended, but will disable the user's ability to type "go back" to
            undo the last choice on that screen.</li>
        <li>Option goes to other screen: If the choice jumps to a screen not directly descended from the previous
            screen.</li>
        <li>Is end screen: Will keep any options from being shown to the user. Use for any screen that is an ending.
        </li>
        <li>Go to: Required if &quot;Option goes to other screen&quot; is checked; References a place on the tree to
            jump to. For example, the path for the screen for door 1 in the
            default game file would be
            &quot;screens.options.door 1&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Notes On Unintended Behaviors of The Tool</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When you toggle a checkbox or add/remove an option, the open/closed state of the dropdowns will reset.</li>
        <li>When you change the name of an option, it will be listed last in the game file and in game in the screen it
            is in. This can be remedied by renaming and naming back all other options in the screen.</li>
        <li>When you press space when renaming an option, the open/closed state of the dropdown will be toggled.</li>
    </ul>
